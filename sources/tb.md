Introduction from recent presentation

After graduating from the Information School at UW, I took an opportunity to work on an exciting project at the intersection of global health and technology. Over the past two years I have worked full time building a patient centered application to support tuberculosis (TB) patients, and help clinicians monitor their treatment progress. I will outline some of the work below.

### Background
TB remains a pressing public health problem, and there are significant challenges that remain in the way of eliminating the disease. A critical challenge for TB control is treatment adherence, or ensuring that patients take every dose of their medication. Taking every pill is no easy task, complicated by the stigma surrounding the disease, the large number of pills each day, and harsh side effects of the medication. Patients left without monitoring and support have treatment completion rates as low as 50%. Even a few missed doses can contribute to the rise of deadly drug resistant strains of TB, and continued disease spread from the uncured patient.

### Solution 
To address this issue, we are building tools that remotely connect providers and patients, and provide accurate monitoring of medication ingestion. 

I built a system of applications that we call Treatment Assistant. It consists of a patient facing mobile application, a drug metabolite test strip, and a web dashboard for clinicians.
